# BogusQuiz

## What is BogusQuiz?

BogusQuiz is a program that allows you to easily attempt quizzes and even create them. In BogusQuiz you can attempt quizzes made by us, or you can even create/import any quiz you want.

BogusQuiz can be used for anything from the bogus online quizzes that tell you how successful you are (no one can do that, except us ;) ), to fun, random quizzes your friends made, and even quizzes for school (will be introduced in the future).

## How are we making BogusQuiz?

BogusQuiz is a program that Tushar (@tushar994) and I created because we were bored of doing our probability assignment. It's coded entirely in C and will probably take forever to finish since we only have so many probability assignments to do.
